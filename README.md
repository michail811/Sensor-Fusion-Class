# Sensor-Fusion-Class

The SensorFusion class is a Python implementation for sensor data fusion techniques, especially designed for obstacles. This class provides methods to visualize synthetic sensor data, apply fusion techniques, and plot the results.

Overview
The following functionalities are provided by the SensorFusion class:

plot_sensor_data: Display the original sensor data from both the obstacle and vision sensors.

plot_fused_data: Show the synthetic sensor data with the fused result.

plot_result: Plot the results of different fusion techniques, such as Average Line Fusion, Combined Line Fusion(Error modeling and minimization), and Combined Line MLE Fusion(Error Minimization).

plot_smoothed_data: Apply Gaussian smoothing to the original sensor data and display the results.
